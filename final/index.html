            <p>Hover, click</p>
            <h2>Rules:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When hover on the card, the content preview container that's hidden behind the image moves to the right, revealing a grey vertical line;</li>
                <li>Then when hover on the area that just has been revealed, the grey line transforms into an arrow pointing towards the right;</li>
                <li>When the user clicks on the arrow, the content container fully reveals itself, showing user the tags, the Key ingredients, and the cost of time. The difficulty will also increases it's opacity and reveals itself at the middle-bottom of the image;</li>
                <li>During this time, the arrow will transforms back to the grey vertical line;</li>
                <li>Then when the user hovers over the grey vertical line once again, the line will transforms into an arrow pointing towards the left;</li>
                <li>When the user clicks on the arrow, the content container retracts, and hides itself under the image once again along with the arrow that has transformed back to a grey vertical line;</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Feedbacks:</h2>
            <p>Same as rules</p>
            <h2>Loops:</h2>
            <p>None</p>
